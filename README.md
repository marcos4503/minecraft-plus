# About this Software

Minecraft Plus is a Launcher that lets you prepare and play the Vanilla+ Modpack created by Marcos Tomaz. Everything is quick, easy, and stress-free. The Launcher doesn't require access to your Mojang account, and you'll only need it if you want to change your skin in-game.

There are several versions of the Vanilla+ Modpack created by Marcos Tomaz, and this Launcher also lets you choose one to play. If you choose a version that isn't ready, the Launcher will take care of everything.

>[!NOTE]
> There is no dedicated server version of this Modpack. To play with friends, open your world to LAN, so players on your local network can join your world. For players outside of your local network, use a program like Hamachi, or if you have Direct NAT, forward ports from your router to your computer.
